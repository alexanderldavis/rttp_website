   			<p>Use this website to learn assignment details and due dates, as well as keep
   			up to date on daily game objectives. Reacting to the Past (RTTP) simulation 
   			games are designed to build educational communities and engage students in 
   			abstract thought outside of the classroom, and this website aims to help 
   			students remain on track of their assignments.</p>
   			<p>RTTP are simulation games based on moments of historical crises. Students 
   			are assigned character roles, which provide an outline to the stance they will 
   			be promoting throughout the simulation.</p>
   			<p>This RTTP game simulation concerns the controversial French election of 
   			2002, which ended in a surprise run-off between a conservative candidate and a
   			candidate representing the alt-right. This election reflects a change in 
   			European politics, with an emphasis on the role of the media in shaping public
   			opinion: in the months before the election, the campaign had indeed 
   			increasingly focused on questions of law and order, with a particular focus on
   			alleged crimes committed by young people, especially those of immigrant 
   			origins. Many alarmist reports on TF1 and France 2 (main television channels)
   			emphasized this alleged crime wave and portrayed Prime Minister Jospin as “too
   			soft” on crime. Despite Chirac landslide victory, the 2002 election marks a 
   			turning point in French politics with the Front National (Le Pen party) 
   			becoming the “third largest” political party and since then being able to 
   			contest many elections.</p>
   			<p>Students embody characters ranging from some of the dozens of available 
   			candidates from the first round, as well as media organizations and voters, in
   			order to simulate the events that lead up to such a divisive election decision.
   			Students must interact with each other and grapple abstract concepts in a 
   			foreign language, providing them with valuable immersion experience.</p>
   			<p>NOTE: This website will continue to improve, following a test of the game in the
   			Spring semester 300 level French course. Feedback on the use of the website by
   			students in the game will inform any changes to the layout or available 
   			information. In later versions of this portal, I hope to implement a sign-in
   			feature to allow students to sign into a personalized website for their
   			character.</p>
