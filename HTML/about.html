   			<p>Reacting to the Past simulations (RTTP) are interactive and unique learning
   			experiences that allow students to immerse themselves into historical events. 
   			RTTP encourages student involvement and provides students a venue to formulate 
   			abstract ideas in foreign languages. Since RTTP addresses real, historical 
   			moments of crisis, students can research these events on their own to increase
   			their chance of winning the simulation. RTTP games also develops friendships 
   			and communities of students that continue to interact with each other outside 
   			of the classroom.</p>
   			<blockquote id="blockquote1">I like the RTTP games because it brings a 
   			fun, different perspective into the classroom. I feel that I learn more and 
   			improve my language more while doing the games, than in a regular class.<br>
   			-Kyla Grau, Luther College '17
   			</blockquote>
   			<p>While it delivers similar information, RTTP simultaneously fosters the 
   			development of community, creativity, and collaborative competition to allow 
   			students to understand material by interacting with the material. Empowering 
   			students to make decisions in RTTP games enables them to engage with other 
   			cultures and develop empathy for historical characters.</p>
   			<p>Several studies conducted on the use of RTTP curriculum suggests that RTTP
   			can in fact contribute to student communities. Working in conjunction with peers
   			on a consistent basis allow students to form friendships at a faster rate than
   			in ordinary classrooms. These friendships are of particular importance at liberal
   			arts institutions, as students focused on their majors have very few 
   			opportunities to interface with students of other majors. By developing these
   			cross-major relationships in language and other courses, students can benefit
   			from a diverse wealth of knowledge and perspectives.</p>
   			<blockquote id="blockquote2">
   			Being in an RTTP game was extremely helpful for me, because it forced me to 
   			interact with people in a more conversational way rather than preparing a 
   			script for the day or memorizing vocabulary to use. It was definitely 
   			competitive, because meeting objectives was fun, and it also helped to create 
   			a community in the classroom. I had never met the people in my group before, 
   			and after the game, I could consider them to be friends.<br>
   			-Desiree Bradshaw, Luther College '17</blockquote>
   			<p>RTTP is an efficient method of building classroom communities with a main
   			goal in mind. Students participating in RTTP games report that they thoroughly
   			enjoyed being able work with fellow peers on a common project, and found that
   			they were more active in their reading of assigned materials.</p>
   			<p>While it delivers similar information, RTTP simultaneously fosters the 
   			development of community, creativity, and collaborative competition to allow 
   			students to understand material by interacting with the material. Empowering 
   			students to make decisions in RTTP games enables them to engage with other 
   			cultures and develop empathy for historical characters.</p>
   			<p>RTTP is a pedagogy that has been implemented at over 200 Universities and 
   			Colleges across the United States. Luther College is proud to host a French
   			program dedicated to implementing the RTTP pedagogy in its classrooms.</p>
